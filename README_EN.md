# Can I root on current version of ZUI instead of downloading a previous release?
Unfortunately, no.<br>
In order to use root tool Magisk, it requires a matched version of boot.img from the current ROM.<br>
While Lenovo doesn't provide their ROMs, it is no way to obtain the correct boot.img.

# Enable developer mode
In ZUI, settings -> about -> software version (zui 15.0.xxx) tapping on it -> in developer mode<br>
Settings -> General -> Developer mode -> Enable USB debugging -> Connect to computer -> trust this computer

# Unlock bootloader
_You lost warranty if you unlock your device and there is no way to lock again, risk on your own_<br>

> If you're bootloader is already unlock skip this step.

Execute `adb reboot bootloader` to fastboot, you will see the tablet's serial number<br>
Go to Lenovo bootunloader unlock application website, provide your SN, Lenovo will send you a link via email<br>
`http://cdn.zui.lenovomm.com/developer/tabletboot/{your SN number}/sn.img`<br>
If you can't wait, you can also replace string `AAAAAAAA` with your SN number in the file `sn_AAAAAAAA.img` from this repo<br>
You need a hex editor to perform the SN update, notepad won't work<br>
Execute `fastboot flash unlock sn.img` to flash sn.img<br>
Execute `fastboot reboot` tablet is now showing unlocked

# 9008 flashing
_bootloader must be unlocked_ [#7](https://github.com/LarrysGIT/Root_TB371FC/issues/7)<br>
Open the device manager from Windows<br>
Disconnect your tablet from Windows<br>
Power off your tablet<br>
Open QFIL.exe to configure as following<br>

- configuration -> Firehose configuration<br>
- - Device type select "ufs"<br>
- - Validation mode select "0 - no validation"<br>
- - Reset after download check on<br>
- - OK<br>
- Build type select "Flat Build"<br>
- Programmer select `prog_firehose_ddr.elf` from your ROM version 405<br>
- Load XML _select ALL xml files_ (important) from your ROM 405<br>

Press and hold volume +, connect tablet with Windows via USB<br>
You should be able to see from the device manager, a device with suffix 9008 shows up<br>
Back to QFIL.exe click on `Download`, flash commences

# Install Magisk and root
Redo `Enable developer mode` and connect your tablet with Windows via USB<br>
Follow the Magisk instruction to patch boot.img and flash it.<br>
- https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/install.html

My steps following<br>
Copy Magisk-v27.0.apk and boot.img (from ROM 405) to tablet<br>
Install Magisk apk and run the app<br>
From Magisk, install -> select and patch a file -> select boot.img<br>
Copy the patched magisk_patched_xxxxxxx.img to Windows<br>
Execute `adb reboot bootloader` to bootloader<br>
Execute `fastboot flash boot magisk_patched_xxxxxxx.img` to flash boot.img<br>
Enter ZUI and run Magisk, you will see the button `superuser` now is clickable<br>
root is completed

# Troubleshooting
## QFIL errors
If you have errors during the ROM flash with QFIL. For example Sahara protocol errors, or path not found errors try using QFIL installed from QPST `https://qpsttool.com/qpst-tool-v2-7-496` instead of the standalone version `https://qfiltool.com/qfil-tool-v2-0-3-5`.(https://github.com/LarrysGIT/Root_TB371FC/issues/1)<br>

## Update ZUI normally via OTA
If you had flahsed with a Magisk patched boot.img, you need to flash the original boot.img first, if you don't do such, OTA will loop between download and upgrade updates, and never finishes.<br>
Execte `adb reboot bootloader` to bootloader<br>
Execute `fastboot flash boot boot.img` to flash the original boot.img<br>

## Disable system OTA update
Execute `adb shell`<br>
Execute `su` it will give error `permission denied`<br>
In Magisk, allow shell to run as root<br>
Execute `su` again<br>
Execute `pm disable com.lenovo.ota`
